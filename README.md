# Android Sexypsf Player

This project is to provide a PlayStation .psf file Player on Android. It uses sexypsf as the core "decoder" to play the .psf file.
For history reason, issues are tracked at Google Code https://code.google.com/p/android-sexypsf-player/issues/list

**PSF** is a sound data file format ripped directly from video games on PlayStation. For detailed information, check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Sound_Format.

Sexypsf is a GPL .psf file player for Linux. It is based on pcsx and peops. It was maintained/hosted by Xodnizel until recently. Now it is an orphan project, but since I still use it I decided to host the releases and some patches on my server. http://projects.raphnet.net/#sexypsf

Psf2 support is in experimental development, which uses Audacious's psfs plugin as the decoder. See https://github.com/audacious-media-player/audacious-plugins for more information.
