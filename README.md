# Android Sexypsf Player

This project is to provide a PlayStation? .psf file Player on Android. It will use sexypsf as the core "decoder" to play the .psf file.

**PSF** is a sound data file format ripped directly from video games on PlayStation?. Detailed information can be get from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Sound_Format.

Sexypsf is a GPL .psf file player for Linux. It is based on pcsx and peops. It was maintained/hosted by Xodnizel until recently. Now it is an orphan project, but since I still use it I decided to host the releases and some patches on my server. http://projects.raphnet.net/#sexypsf
